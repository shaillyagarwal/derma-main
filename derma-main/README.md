Preliminary Skin Diagnosis Tool

Overview
The Preliminary Skin Diagnosis Tool is an AI-powered application designed to identify and classify skin diseases from medical images. By leveraging machine learning and image segmentation techniques, this tool offers a scalable and non-invasive solution for early disease detection, potentially improving patient outcomes.

Key Features
Image Segmentation: Utilizes scikit-image for preprocessing and segmenting skin disease images.
Neural Network Model: Employs a neural network trained via Backpropagation to classify various skin conditions.
Scalability: Designed to handle large datasets, offering the potential for real-world application in healthcare diagnostics.
Non-Invasive: Provides early detection capabilities, reducing the need for invasive diagnostic procedures.

Dataset
The project uses a dataset of 12,000 labeled images, consisting of various skin conditions. Each image is preprocessed using scikit-image for segmentation, which is crucial for extracting the relevant features for disease classification.

Technologies Used
Languages: Python
Libraries:
scikit-learn
scikit-image
TensorFlow/Keras (for neural network implementation)
NumPy, Pandas (for data handling)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
Future Improvements
Integrating more advanced deep learning techniques (e.g., CNNs) to further improve classification accuracy.
Expanding the model to include more skin conditions and rare diseases.
Building a user-friendly front-end interface for healthcare professionals to upload images and view diagnostic results.
